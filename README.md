# Bitcoin Puzzle Progressive Solver

An advanced statistical solver for Bitcoin puzzle challenges using progressive refinement, Hamming distance analysis, and intelligent sampling strategies.

## üéØ Overview

This solver is designed for the [Bitcoin Puzzle Challenge](https://privatekeys.pw/puzzles/bitcoin-puzzle-tx), which presents a series of Bitcoin addresses with known private key ranges but unknown exact keys. The challenge involves finding private keys for addresses containing significant Bitcoin balances.

### Key Features

- **Progressive Refinement**: Multi-level granularity approach (10% ‚Üí 5% ‚Üí 1% ‚Üí 0.1% ‚Üí 0.01%)
- **Statistical Analysis**: Hamming distance-based evaluation with entropy analysis
- **Enhanced Metrics**: Gradient analysis, bit significance scoring, pattern consistency
- **Memory Efficiency**: Avoids redundant sampling of previously explored keys
- **Multiprocessing**: Parallel evaluation across CPU cores
- **Google Colab Support**: Cloud execution with Google Drive integration
- **Checkpoint System**: Resume interrupted searches automatically
- **Historical Intelligence**: Uses data from previously solved puzzles

## üßÆ Current Configuration

- **Target Puzzle**: #71
- **Target Address**: `1PWo3JeB9jrGwfHDNpdGK54CRas7fsVzXU`
- **Search Range**: `2^70` to `2^71 - 1`

## üî¨ Technical Approach

### Statistical Evaluation
The solver evaluates private key ranges using multiple metrics:

- **Hamming Distance**: Bit-level differences between generated and target HASH160
- **Gradient Analysis**: Rate of change across key ranges
- **Bit Significance**: Which bit positions consistently match target
- **Pattern Consistency**: Correlation between bit patterns
- **Entropy Analysis**: Distribution randomness assessment

### Progressive Refinement Strategy
1. **Level 0 (10%)**: Divide search space into 10 segments
2. **Level 1 (5%)**: Refine to 20 segments  
3. **Level 2 (1%)**: Further refine to 100 segments
4. **Level 3 (0.1%)**: Ultra-fine with 1,000 segments
5. **Level 4+ (0.01%+)**: Extreme precision exploration

### Intelligent Sampling
- Historical puzzle solution analysis
- Bit-pattern aware sampling
- Edge case prioritization (0-5% and 95-100% ranges)
- Complementary sampling to avoid redundancy

## üöÄ Installation & Usage

### Local Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
